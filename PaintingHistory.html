            <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px">
                As you might have guessed by now i am a fan of painting! Here are two examples of paintings that i have made. As you may notice they are both different styles. This is because i like to experiment with the types of my paintings.
            </p>

            <!-- first picture container -->
            <div style="margin-top: 50px;">

                <!-- picture -->
                <p style="float: left; text-align: center; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <a href="Images/warfram_eq_img.png" class="swipebox" title="my caption"><img src="Images/warfram_eq_img.png" alt="My painting" /></a>
                    <br>
                </p>

                <!-- Explenation -->
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px"><br> This is a piece i did on the game warframe. I had been recently playing it alot and was interested by all the different character designs. I decided to paint a piece on equinox. A playable character. This character holds both equaly offensive and defensive characteristics and can when leveled up be verry powerful. I like the way the colour and aura of equinox contrasts with the dark and foggy background.

            <!-- Second picuture container -->
            <div style="margin-top: 50px">

                <!-- picture -->
                <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 20px">
                    <a href="Images/bob_ross_mountain_img.jpeg" class="swipebox" title="Bob Ross interpretation"><img src="Images/bob_ross_mountain_img.jpeg" alt="My painting" /></a>
                    <br>
                </p>

                <!-- Explenation -->
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px"><br> This was inspired by a non stop marathon of bob ross on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/212568086">twitch.tv</a> and i was interested by his unique painting style. This was my take on one of his more popular paintings. There were many scrapped versions that fortunatley you dont have to see. I has alot of fun painting this painting as it was more of a do it your own way kind of painting which are the kind i enjoy most.
