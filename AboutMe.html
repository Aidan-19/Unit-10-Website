                Hi! Welcome to the about me section where i will well... Talk about myself for a page. My name is Ron and i am currently working self employed at Robs tattoos. It has been a long 5 years and during those 5 years i had to work from bottom to top of Parlour tattoos.
                <br><br> I started as their cleaner and gained interest in the art of tattooing and painting whilst i worked there. Each time i would clean up i would have to put away the design books ready for the next day and each day i would look for designs that would interst me in those books. When i realised there were none that interested me i decided to make one myself. Once this was completed i showed one of the tatto artists when they were leaving. She was impressed with my work and gave me a task to make a custom design that she could potentialty put on a customer. One week later i gave her my final design and she accepted it and added it to the design book. In the follwoing weeks i would be given more tasks and eventualy be offered a place as an artist there.
                <br><br> I of course took this offer and then did the same with tattooing. Only becoming intersted at first but i soon got the hang of it by practicing on fake skin. This is when i was offered a place as a tatto artist. I worked there for two more years before opening my own shop.
                <br><br> Buisness was slow when i began my shop but it soon picked up once my talent was shared around the various social media sites. Fast forward 5 years and you are at my current position. Buisness is good, i can afford a nice apartment and all is good with my life.
                <br><br> That is a short-ish version of my history and im sure it will soon change either for better or worse but i take life with one stride at a time.
                <br><br>
